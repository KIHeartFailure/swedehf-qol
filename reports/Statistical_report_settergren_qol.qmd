# Data

## Data sources

The Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) is an ongoing nationwide quality registry started in 2000, 
that includes in- and out-hospital patients with HF, regardless of EF and previous history of HF[@swedehf]. 
Around 80 variables are recorded at 
discharge from hospital or at the outpatient visit, i.e. index date, and 
entered into an electronic database managed by the Uppsala Clinical Research 
Center (Uppsala, Sweden). Up to April 2017 the only inclusion criterion was a 
clinical diagnosis of HF, which was thereafter defined according to the ICD-10 
codes I50.0, I50.1, I50.9, I42.0, I42.6, I42.7, I25.5, I11.0, I13.0, I13.2. 
In 2021, 69 of 76 Swedish hospitals enrolled patients in SwedeHF, which had a 32% coverage of the prevalent HF population in Sweden[@annualreport]. 

SwedeHF was linked with national Swedish registries (SHFDB v 4.1.1) through the 
Swedish personal identity number (PIN)[@pin]: 

- The National Patient Register (The National Board of Health and Welfare) for 
additional comorbidities and the hospitalization outcomes
- The Cause of Death Register[@dors] (The National Board of Health and Welfare) for outcomes 
death
- Longitudinal integrated database for health insurance and labour market studies (LISA)[@lisa] 
and the Register of the Total Population (Statistics Sweden) for socio-economic factors

## Acknowledgments

Please include "We thank all staff members at care units reporting into the SwedeHF registry for their contribution." 
in the Acknowledgements of any resulting articles. 

## Ethics and Informed consent

The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority, dnr 2021-04326. 
Individual consent was not required, but patients were informed of entry into SwedeHF and able to opt‐out.

# Statistical analysis 

## General

All analyses were performed using `r sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string` [@r]. 
The level of significance is set to 5%, two-sided. No adjustment for multiple 
comparisons were made and therefore the results should be viewed with care.

## Missing data

Missing data was imputed with multiple imputation (n = 10) using mice [@mice] and Rubin’s rules was used for combining estimates and standard errors across imputed data sets. 
Variables included in the model are indicated in @tbl-base. 
All-cause death was included as the Nelson-Aalen estimator.

## Baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics are presented by QoL. 
Categorical variables are presented with n and percentage and tested for 
differences between groups with the chi-square test. 
Continuous variables are presented with median [first quartile-third quartile] and tested for 
differences between groups with the Kruskal-Wallis test. 

Separate analyses were further performed for the respective EF groups. 

FRÅGA: Kolla noga igenom variabler i tabell och vilka som ska justeras för i modeller. 

## Independent associations between baseline characteristics and QoL

The association between baseline characteristics and QoL was evaluated using a multivariable multinominal regression 
including the variables indicated in @tbl-base (all shown in @fig-predictors). The variables were selected based on clinical relevance. 

FRÅGA: Ska out of breath mm (övriga qol variabler) justeras för???? Är dessa en del av QoL?

FRÅGA: Ska detta göras uppdelat på EF (så associationer mellan QoL och baseline char INOM respektive EF grupp)? 

### Assumptions

Possible outliers were evaluated using Cook's distance and multicollinearity was 
evaluated using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). TO BE CHECKED

## Association between outcomes and QoL

The following outcomes are considered: 

- `r paste0(outvars$name[1], " (", outvars$shortname[1], ") (primary outcome)")`
- `r paste0(outvars$name[2], " (", outvars$shortname[2], ")")`
- `r paste0(outvars$name[3], " (", outvars$shortname[3], ")")`
- `r paste0(outvars$name[4], " (", outvars$shortname[4], ")")`

Time to first events were presented with cumulative incidence curves by QoL. Separate figures were also performed for the respective EF groups. 

Crude and adjusted analyses were performed where adjustment was performed for 
variables indicated in @tbl-base. 

Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to model the time to first event. 
As a consistency analysis for the secondary outcomes, a sub-distributional hazards model[@fg] was used, 
where deaths not defined as an event were treated as competing events.

Data were censored at `r global_followup_years` years follow-up, 2021-12-31 or emigration from Sweden. 

Separate analyses were further performed for the respective EF groups. 

FRÅGA: SKA KLIPPA VID 5 ÅR? 10 år? Aldrig?

FRÅGA: OK utfall?

### Association between outcomes and QoL - Subgroups

Associations across pre-specified subgroups were evaluated using an interaction term between QoL and the 
respective variable for the primary outcome and presented in a Forest plot. 

FRÅGA: FUNDERA PÅ ATT EV TA BORT utfallstab uppdelat på EF. Finns i Subgrupps forestplot. note to self: ändra då KM fig så tas från itneraktionsmodell och inte subgrupper. 

### Assumptions

The proportional hazards assumption was investigated using the scaled Schoenfeld 
residuals for the primary outcome leading to that `r paste0(stratavars, collapse = ", ")` was stratified for in the models. 
Possible outliers were visually inspected by plotting the dfbetas. TO BE CHECKED.

# Results

```{r}
med <- rsdata %>%
  summarise(
    med = fn(median(shf_age), dig = 0),
    q1 = fn(quantile(shf_age, probs = 0.25), dig = 0),
    q3 = fn(quantile(shf_age, probs = 0.75), dig = 0)
  ) %>%
  mutate(out = paste0(med, " (", q1, "-", q3, ")")) %>%
  pull(out)

percfem <- rsdata %>%
  count(shf_sex) %>%
  mutate(perc = fn(n / sum(n) * 100, 0)) %>%
  filter(shf_sex == "Female") %>%
  pull(perc)
```

The median (q1-q3) age is `r med` and `r percfem`% females.

    min = fn(min(sos_outtime_death / 365.25 * 12), dig = 0),
    max = fn(max(sos_outtime_death / 365.25 * 12), dig = 0)
  ) %>%
  mutate(out = paste0(med, " (", min, "-", max, ")")) %>%
  pull(out)

sumsurv <- rsdata %>%
  summarise(sumpy = fn(sum(sos_outtime_death) / 365.25, dig = 0)) %>%
  pull(sumpy)
```

The median (min-max) follow-up is 
`r medsurv` months for a total of `r sumsurv` patient-years of follow-up.
